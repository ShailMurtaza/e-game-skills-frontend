                    <p>
                        We are a team of passionate gamers and computer science
                        students driven by the idea of bridging the gap between
                        talented players and e-sports organizations. Having
                        spent countless hours playing competitive games like
                        Valorant and Dota 2, we understand how hard it can be
                        for skilled players to get noticed — and for teams to
                        find the right talent that fits their playstyle and
                        strategy.

                    <p>
                        Our vision is to redefine e-sports recruitment by
                        creating a platform where skill and merit truly shine.
                        We aim to build a global network of gamers, from
                        aspiring amateurs to professional players, providing
                        them with opportunities to showcase their abilities and
                        connect with teams that value their expertise.

                    <p>
                        Our platform, E Game Skills, serves as a structured
                        recruitment system for competitive gaming.

                        It helps:

                                Teams discover players based on in-game skills,
                                ranks, and performance metrics.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Players gain visibility and get discovered by
                                organizations seeking new talent.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        By focusing on data-driven matching and transparent
                        player profiles, we remove bias and emphasize what
                        really matters — skill, dedication, and teamwork.

                    <p>
                        As gamers ourselves, we’ve seen both sides of the
                        challenge:
                        <ul className="list-disc mx-10">
                            <li>Talented players often lack visibility.</li>
                            <li>
                                Teams spend hours searching for the right
                                members.{" "}
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        This inspired us to combine our technical expertise in
                        programming, cybersecurity, and software engineering
                        with our passion for e-sports to develop a practical,
                        scalable solution.
